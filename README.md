# DiscoverOrgSmartFridge

Quick coding problem as a demonstration of Java understanding.

Consists of a SmartFridge, provided SmartFridgeManager interface and a FridgeItem storage class.

Improvements Needed:
- Consider a database instead of local storage
- Write tests/test client
- Comment code for clarity
